# FetchFilteredWikiSentences

This is a helper code used while working on ONRE(https://github.com/Open-NRE) to filter required numerical sentences from wikipedia.

Extracts the sentences from wikipedia (uses WikiXMLParser) and filters required numerical sentences.
The wikipedia files are not added here for the obvious reason (too large files).
